      that I love and consider my home away from home. I have not yet solidified where I want to go, whether it be
      cyber security, software development, mobile app development, or somewhere else but at this point, cyber security or Web development
      looks to be the direction I am leaning. Additionally, I plan to have some personal projects completed and new ones ongoing.</p>

        I began my journey at the University of Nevada, Reno in the August of 2014. I’ve learned much from my time spent here. Moving away 
        from home and living on my own with only myself to support me was a challenge. I had to learn how to be an adult on my own. I 
        struggled at first and College is taking longer than expected but I held on and didn’t give up. I am now entering my last year 
        at the University and putting everything I have into it. Getting involved is high on my list and maybe travelling abroad again if I can manage it.

        In the Summer of 2019, I had the amazing opportunity to go study abroad for two weeks. I went to the Ensenada, Mexico and studied
        at CETYS University taking a class in Cross Cultural Management. We had the privilege to visit a couple factories, Fender and Navico,
        while we were there to get an inside look at businesses in another country and how they operate. I learned many things from this
        experience and hope to do it again in the future.

      <p class="text-justify">
        High school seems so far away now. I went to two different high schools, Nevada Union and Ghidotti, both located in Grass Valley, CA. 
        First was Nevada Union. This was the primary high school everyone went to in my town. I spent two years here not feeling challenged 
        and felt out of place, since most people were there just to graduate and not really learn. I then transferred schools to Ghidotti, 
        which is an Early College High School located on the Nevada County Campus of Sierra College, just up the hill from Nevada Union. 
        Many of my friends from middle school went here so fitting in was so easy. My group of friends grew rapidly, and I felt like I belonged. 
        I was welcomed by the school with open arms. Here I grew faster educationally and challenged myself, especially in Math. This laid the 
        foundation for me to succeed in college where my siblings, parents, and grandparents couldn’t.

      <p><b>Midway Games Operator</b></p>
      <p class="text-justify">
          My first job was at the Circus Circus Midway as a Games Operator. I spent a little more than a year there working in the booth games 
          then moving up into the ticket redemption booth. As a Games Operator, I learned the basics of customer service and what it meant to 
          give someone an experience to remember rather than just doing my job. I invested passion into my work and brought a smile to work every 
          day, some people ended up calling me Smiley. Once being moved into the Redemption Booth, I became one of the two people that kept the 
          games filled with tickets and in working order. Management liked me there since I learned fast and moved fast. I handled large amount 
          of service calls and created a plan with my partner to keep the games going in an efficient way. Building a relationship with management 
          and other departments helped me expanded and offered me an opportunity to transfer in which I spent about six months in the Cage.
      </p></br>

      <p><b>Cage Cashier</b></p>
      <p class="text-justify">
        To expand myself and learn more about the company I worked for, I transferred from the Midway to the Cage. Here, as a cashier, I learned 
        to be much better with money handling and proper procedures for many situations such as a robbery, power outages, and system failures. My 
        time was short as a cashier, but the time spent here was invaluable in my future positions as a Supervisor and Main Banker. I used much of
         my money handling and customer service skills to help improve my employee's performance by teaching them the proper skills.
      </p></br>

      <p><b>Midway Supervisor</b></p>
      <p class="text-justify">
          After the six months in the Cage, I was offered the opportunity to go back to the Midway as a Supervisor. This was the position I grew 
          to love, I was able to implement change with management and help improve the quality of service we offered on the Midway to give the 
          best experience possible. The hardest part from transitioning from staff to management was overseeing people who were my peers, some 
          being much older than me. I was the young unexperienced supervisor who didn’t know what they were doing but after a while I grew into 
          my role and flourished. Many people started calling me their favorite supervisor, there were three off us, me being the head supervisor 
          of Swing Shift. Although I was appreciated as a supervisor and I loved the position, I ended up leaving in order to have a more flexible 
          schedule and the ability to go part-time while I was in school.
      </p></br>

      <p><b>Cage Main Bank Cashier</b></p>
      <p class="text-justify">
        My most recent position was as a Main Bank Cashier at The Row. Circus Circus Reno was bought out by Eldorado Resorts and then merged the 
        three properties, Eldorado, Silver Legacy, and Circus Circus, into what they now call The Row. From here, I bounced around from each of the 
        three casinos working in the Cage. The Main Bank Cashier is the second in command right under the Supervisor on duty. I would take charge 
        when needed to cover the Supervisor’s break or if the Supervisor was busy. They valued my experience as a Supervisor on the Midway and my 
        experience in the Cage, so I was able to keep the Cage running. Cage management offered me many opportunities to advance in the Cage as a 
        supervisor or transfer to another department more focused into my field, but I declined both offers due to lack scheduling flexibility, as 
        a Supervisor, or scheduling conflicts with my classes, IT department.

          Through the University of Nevada, the curriculum takes you through many areas of the computer science field including embedded systems, cyber security, game design, algorithms, data structures,
          some parallel computing, and many more things. Diving into security and learning 
          how many things such as worms, viruses, code injections, DOS attacks, and many other things can cause a lot of damage and compromise privacy and 
          confidential information really hooked my interest. Because of that, I am delving deeper into this area going into the Fall 2019 semester. Additionally, I have increasingly grown to enjoy web 
          development while creating this website and expanding my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and the Bootstrap framework.
